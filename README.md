Family Travel Tracker

The original travel tracker project was only having a home page. After inserting a country, if the country was not already saved in the databse, the country would be colored on the map and the total countries displayed would have been increased.

If the country was already inserted a message would show:

![countryalreadyinserted](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8340f56d-44d7-4bd2-89d7-249baea2f3f5)

The Family Travel Tracker version, would display multiple profiles on the home page

![main page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9cd4535-7ccc-479d-8107-c45d6db76f29)

Each member having their own visited countries colored on the map with their assigned color.

You can add a new member: 

![addmember](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2037aaa0-1c4c-4ccc-a250-c16e128834b7)

And after that the home page would be re-rendered with the new member's page displayed.
